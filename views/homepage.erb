      <h3>Mod My Ride (work in progress)</h3>
      <span>Currently developing a full-stack, cross-platform mobile/web
            application using the Python Flet Framework. The focus is on
            creating an interactive interface that allows users to explore and
            visualize vehicle modifications. Additionally, integrating in-app
            insights to provide information on car mods, unique features, and
            common faults. The goal is to enhance the user experience and
            empower automotive enthusiasts with valuable knowledge.

      <h3>Soccer Team DB</h3>
      <span>I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive Soccer Team
            Database. Leveraging Java, I seamlessly integrated programs with
            MySQL using JDBC and SQL. My responsibilities extended to designing
            and implementing essential components, including database views,
            stored procedures, and functions. These optimizations ensured
            efficient data management. Additionally, I orchestrated seamless
            database interactions, executed intricate queries, and skillfully
            retrieved results.

    <h3>Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm</h3>
      <span>I developed a Tic Tac Toe game using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library for
            the graphical user interface. The game features both player vs.
            player and player vs. computer modes, with the latter utilizing the
            minimax algorithm for AI decision-making. Additionally, I designed a
            user-friendly interface complete with buttons for restarting the
            game and returning to the main menu, ensuring smooth navigation for
            players.
