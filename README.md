# Benny's Portfolio Website

This website showcases my current projects, past work, and a little bit about me. It includes pictures of projects, 
links to source codes, and more. Iâ€™ve utilized Google Maps and the Pirate Weather Key API to identify 
my location and check the weather, determining whether or not I need an umbrella. The site was built using Sinatra.

To run the web server locally, run in terminal: ```bin/server``` and open port 3000
